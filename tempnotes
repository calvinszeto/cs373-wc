-----

On export:
Want to go use a loop, one for crises, one for organizations, one for people. Thus, template values must all be lists. 
DONE.

-----

To create parent-child relationship:
{
inf = Info(parent=cris, **info_dict)

Then, during export:
crises = Crisis.all()
infos = Info.all()

for c in crises:
    i = infos.ancestor(c).get() # returns the info for c
}
Done.

Can you use the same infos Query for the next crisis or do you need to make a new one?
YES.

-----

On accepting multiple refs:
1. How do we make sure there is at least one of each kind?
    Do a findall on each type of ref; if the list is empty then it's invalid.
        Done.
    Still need a ref-type attribute for the export.
        Done.
2. For the template, we need code in the template to iterate through some list of values.
    Done.
