Name: The Global Polio Eradication Initiative
Kind: The Global Polio Eradication Initiative is a public-private partnership led by national governments and spearheaded by the World Health Organization (WHO), Rotary International, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and the United Nations Childrenâ€™s Fund (UNICEF).
Location: Geneva, Switzerland.
History: Since 1988, more than 2.5 billion children have been immunized against polio thanks to the unprecedented cooperation of more than 200 countries and 20 million volunteers, backed by an international investment of over US$ 8 billion. By 2006, only four countries remained that had never stopped polio transmission, and annual case numbers had decreased by over 99%.  In 2008, the World Health Assembly called for a new strategy to eradicate polio from the remaining affected countries and finally rid the world of polio. The Global Polio Eradication Initiative launched an intensified eradication effort involving the wide-scale use of new tools and tactics in each country, with renewed commitment by their leaders and donors.
